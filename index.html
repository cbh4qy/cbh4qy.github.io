 			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this is my first attempt at higher education in a while. Going well so far, trainwrecks aside. I like dogs.</p>
 			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't much like cats. They like me though, which is usually ok, though sometimes not. Had a cat once; his name was Taz, like the Loony Toon. He...really loved spinning.</p>
